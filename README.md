Overview
This project is a simple command-line-based to-do list application written in Python. It allows users to manage their tasks by adding, viewing, and removing them from the list. It's a great project to practice Python programming and learn basic file handling.

Features
Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
View Tasks: Users can view all the tasks they have added.
Remove Tasks: Users can remove tasks that have been completed or are no longer needed.
Save Tasks: The to-do list is saved in a text file, so tasks are preserved even after the program is closed.
